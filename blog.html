            <h3>Why ambitious teenagers should learn to code.</h3>
            <h6>Monday October 14 2019</h6>
            <br>
            <p>My assumption if you're reading this is that you're a super ambitious individual who want's to impact a ton of people. If you think you fall under this bucket,
            keep reading! This post is supposed to be an extension of one of my favourite articles by Sam Altman.
            <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds">Advice for Ambitious 19 Year olds.</a>
            Highly recommend that you read this article before reading the rest of this post. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In the article Sam Altman does a great job of describing what an ambitious teenager should choose
            to do during some of their most productive years. The three main options he outlines is 1) Going
            to college and building a bunch of side projects. 2) Joining a company with high growth potential (Rocket Ships)
            3) Go start a company around something you really want. I believe as a teenager, your priority should be
            to learn a ton and any one of those 3 options can you lead you on a path to high growth. 
            </p>
            <br> 
            <p>
            Now for many of you, you're probably thinking that any one of these options would be great but how 
            do I even put myself in a position where I can get these options. I think that from being in this position and talking 
            to a lot of smart teenagers in the same position, the best method is to learn to code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In the startup world, there's this methodology which many people preach: You want to give yourself as many unfair advantages as possible.
            Being a hacker/developer will always give you an advantage in any of these 3 situations. Whether you want to build side projects, work for a rocketship 
            or start your own company. I'll explain my point with some anecdotes and examples.
